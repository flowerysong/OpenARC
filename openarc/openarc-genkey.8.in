.TH openarc-genkey 8 "The Trusted Domain Project"
.SH NAME
.B openarc-genkey
\- ARC filter key generation tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B openarc-genkey
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B openarc-genkey
generates (1) a private key for signing messages using
.I openarc(8)
and (2) a DNS TXT record suitable for inclusion in a zone file which
publishes the matching public key for use by remote ARC verifiers.

The filenames of these are based on the selector (see below) and the domain;
the private key will have a suffix of ".key" and the TXT record
will have a suffix of ".txt".

It is recommended to run openarc-genkey as user openarc to have
correct file permissions:

sudo openarc openarc-genkey ...

Both long and short names are supported for most options.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-a
(\-\-append-domain)
Appends the domain name (see \-d below) to the label in the generated
TXT record, followed by a trailing period.  By default it is assumed the
domain name is implicit from the context of the zone file, and is therefore
not included in the output.

.TP
.I \-b bits
(\-\-bits=n)
Specifies the size of the key, in
.I bits,
to be generated.  The upstream default is 1024, but here the default
is 2048 based on more current recommendations such as those from NIST 800-177.
RFC8463 recommends Ed25519-SHA256, but it is not clear that all major email
providers have adopted this yet.


.TP
.I \-d domain
(\-\-domain=string)
Names the
.I domain
which will use this key for signing.  Currently only used in a comment in
the TXT record file.  The default is "@DOMAIN@".

.TP
.I \-D directory
(\-\-directory=path)
Instructs the tool to change to the named
.I directory
prior to creating files.  By default the current directory is used.

.TP
.I \-\-ed25519
generate a ed25519 key.

.TP
.I \-h algorithms
(\-\-hash-algorithms=name[:name[...]])
Specifies a list of hash
.I algorithms
which can be used with this key.  Upstream, by default all hash algorithms are
allowed, but here this is restricted to sha256 based on NIST 800-177.

.TP
.I \-\-help
Print a help message and exit.

.TP
.I \-n note
(\-\-note=string)
Includes arbitrary
.I note
text in the key record.  By default, no such text is included.

.TP
.I \-r
(\-\-restrict)
Restricts the key for use in e-mail signing only.  The default is to allow
the key to be used for any service.

.TP
.I \-s selector
(\-\-selector=name)
Specifies the
.I selector,
or name, of the key pair generated.  The default is "default".

.TP
.I \-S
(\-\-[no]subdomains)
Disallows subdomain signing by this key.  By default the key record will be
generated such that verifiers are told subdomain signing is permitted.  Note
that for backward compatibility reasons,
.I \-S
means the same as
.I \-\-nosubdomains.

.TP
.I \-t
(\-\-[no]testmode)
Indicates the generated key record should be tagged such that verifiers are
aware ARC is in test at the signing domain.

.TP
.I -v
(\-\-verbose)
Increase verbose output.

.TP
.I -V
(\-\-version)
Print version number and exit.
.SH NOTES
Requires that the
.I openssl(8)
binary be installed and in the executing shell's search path.
.SH VERSION
This man page covers the version of
.I openarc-genkey
that shipped with version @VERSION@ of
