.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Xr openarc 8
implements the ARC (Authenticated Received Chain)
specification for verifying authentication and handling of messages as
they are routed to their destinations.
This is its configuration file.

Blank lines are ignored.
Lines containing a hash ("#") character are truncated at the hash character
to allow for comments in the file.

Other content should be the name of a parameter, followed by white space,
followed by the value of that parameter.
Each parameter must be on a separate line.

For parameters that are Boolean in nature, only the first byte of
the value is processed.
For positive values, the following are accepted:
.Cm T ,
.Cm t ,
.Cm Y ,
.Cm y ,
.Cm 1 .

For negative values, the following are accepted:
.Cm F ,
.Cm f ,
.Cm N ,
.Cm n ,
.Cm 0 .

See the
.Xr openarc 8
man page for details about how and when the configuration file contents
are reloaded.

Unless otherwise stated, boolean values default to
.Cm false ,
integer values default to
.Cm 0 ,
and string and dataset values default to being undefined.

.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width Ds

.It Cm AuthResIP Pq boolean
Controls whether Authentication-Results headers include the remote IP.

.It Cm AuthservID Pq string
.Ar authserv-id
to use in Authentication-Results headers.

.It Cm AutoRestart Pq boolean
Automatically re-start on failures.
Use with caution; if the filter fails instantly after it starts, this can
cause a tight
.Xr fork 2
loop.

.It Cm AutoRestartCount Pq integer
Sets the maximum automatic restart count.
After this number of automatic restarts, the filter will give up and terminate.
A value of
.Cm 0
implies no limit; this is the default.

.It Cm AutoRestartRate Pq string
Sets the maximum automatic restart rate.
If the filter begins restarting faster than the rate defined here, it will
give up and terminate.
This is a string of the form
.Ar n/t[u]
where
.Ar n
is an integer limiting the count of restarts in the given interval and
.Ar t[u]
defines the time interval through which the rate is calculated;
.Ar t
is an integer and
.Ar u
defines the units thus represented ("s" or "S" for seconds, the default;
"m" or "M" for minutes; "h" or "H" for hours; "d" or "D" for days).  For
example, a value of "10/1h" limits the restarts to 10 in one hour.  There
is no default, meaning restart rate is not limited.

.It Cm Background Pq boolean
Causes
.Xr openarc 8
to fork and exit immediately, leaving the service running in the background.
The default is
.Cm true .

.It Cm BaseDirectory Pq string
Directory to switch to before beginning operation.

.It Cm Canonicalization Pq string
Selects the canonicalization method(s) to be used when signing messages.
When verifying, the message's ARC-Message-Signature: header field specifies
the canonicalization method.
The recognized values are
.Cm relaxed
and
.Cm simple
as defined by the DKIM specification.  The default is
.Cm relaxed/simple.
The value may include two different canonicalizations separated by a
slash ("/") character, in which case the first will be applied to the
header and the second to the body.

.It Cm ChangeRootDirectory Pq string
Requests that the operating system change the effective root directory
of the process to the one specified here prior to beginning execution.
.Xr chroot 2
requires superuser access. A warning will be generated if
.Cm UserID
is not also set.

.It Cm Domain Pq string
Domain to use when signing messages. Required for signing.

.It Cm EnableCoredumps Pq boolean
On systems that have such support, make an explicit request to the kernel
to dump cores when the filter crashes for some reason.
Some modern UNIX systems suppress core dumps during crashes for security
reasons if the user ID has changed during the lifetime of the process.
Currently only supported on Linux.

.It Cm FinalReceiver Pq boolean
Add a non-standard
.Cm arc.chain
field to the Authentication-Results header, showing the domains
present in the ARC chain.

.It Cm FixedTimestamp Pq string
Used for testing.
This is not useful in a production environment.

.It Cm Include Pq string
Names a file to be opened and read as an additional configuration file.
Nesting is allowed to a maximum of five levels.

.It Cm InternalHosts Pq dataset
Identifies a set of hosts whose connections should be treated as
"internal" by this filter.
Messages received from such sources will not be verified and are instead
trusted as-is; in particular, their Authentication-Results fields are
trusted to be correct and authentic, meaning they will be assumed to
contain the correct chain status when generating an outgoing seal.
See the description of "PeerList" for a description of the supported format.
If no set is provided, "127.0.0.1" is added to the list by default.

.It Cm KeepTemporaryFiles Pq boolean
Preserve temporary files generated during signing or verification for
debugging purposes.
This can use up disk space very quickly on busy systems.

.It Cm KeyFile Pq string
Path to the private key to use when signing. Required for signing.

.It Cm MaximumHeaders Pq integer
Disable processing for messages where the header section is larger than this
value (in bytes.)
.Cm 0
disables this check, the default is
.Cm 65536 .

.It Cm MilterDebug Pq integer
Sets the debug level to be requested from the milter library.
The default is
.Cm 0 .

.It Cm MinimumKeySizeRSA Pq integer
Disallows signatures whose keys are smaller than the specified size,
regardless of whether they would otherwise be valid. If this is not
set the library's default (which is currently
.Cm 1024 )
will be used.

.It Cm Mode Pq string
Selects the operating mode(s) for this filter.
If the string contains the character "s", the filter will seal messages
passing through the filter by adding a new ARC set.
If the string contains the character "v", the filter will validate existing
ARC sets and record the chain validation status in an "Authentication-Results"
header.
The two can be combined.
If neither is specified, the operating mode will be inferred on a
per-connection basis based on the entries in the
.Cm InternalHosts
list; connections from internal hosts will be assigned to signing mode,
and all others will be assigned to verify mode.

.It Cm OversignHeaders Pq string
Specifies a comma-separated list of header field names that should be
included in all signature header lists (the "h=" tag) once more than the
number of times they were actually present in the signed message.
The set is empty by default.
The purpose of this, and especially of listing an absent header field, is to
prevent the addition of important fields between the signer and the verifier.
Since the verifier would include that header field when performing
verification if it had been added by an intermediary, the signed message and
the verified message were different and the verification would fail.
Note that listing a field name here and not listing it in the
.Cm SignHeaders
list is likely to generate invalid signatures.

.It Cm PeerList Pq dataset
Identifies a set of "peers" that identifies clients whose connections
should be accepted without processing by this filter.  The set
should contain on each line a hostname, domain name (e.g. ".example.com"),
IP address, an IPv6 address (including an IPv4 mapped address), or a
CIDR-style IP specification (e.g. "192.168.1.0/24").  An entry beginning
with a bang ("!") character means "not", allowing exclusions of specific
hosts that are otherwise members of larger sets.  Host and domain names are
matched first, then the IP or IPv6 address depending on the connection
type.  More precise entries are preferred over less precise ones, i.e.
"192.168.1.1" will match before "!192.168.1.0/24".  The text form of IPv6
addresses will be forced to lowercase when queried (RFC5952), so the contents
of this data set should also use lowercase.  The IP address portion of an
entry may optionally contain square brackets; both forms (with and without)
will be checked.

.It Cm PermitAuthenticationOverrides Pq boolean
Controls whether a previous Authentication-Result with the same
.Ar authserv-id
is allowed to override the computed ARC chain validation status.
The default is
.Cm false
because this can be unsafe unless you have taken steps to ensure that
the Authentication-Result headers seen by the filter are legitimate.

.It Cm PidFile Pq string
Specifies the path to a file that should be created at process start
containing the process ID.

.It Cm RequireSafeKeys Pq boolean
Controls whether the filter requires that private keys have safe file
permissions.

.It Cm ResponseDisabled Pq string
.Brq Cm accept | discard | reject | tempfail

Response to send after determining that this message is one that
the filter is configured not to process.
See
.Cm SealHeaderChecks
and
.Cm PeerList .
The default is
.Cm accept .

.It Cm ResponseUnable Pq string
.Brq Cm accept | discard | reject | tempfail

Response to send after an internal error occurs that makes it
impossible to finish processing the message.
The default is
.Cm tempfail .

.It Cm ResponseUnwilling Pq string
.Brq Cm accept | discard | reject | tempfail

Response to send after a message fails basic validity checks, such as
.Cm MaximumHeaders .
The default is
.Cm reject .

.It Cm SealHeaderChecks Pq string
Identifies a file containing header checks that should be done to determine
whether to seal a message.
Each entry in this file must be of the form
.Ar name:regexp .
When this feature is set, messages will only be processed by the filter if
any instance of the named header field exists and has a value matching the
provided regular expression.
If the value of an instance appears to be a JSON list, then the regular
expression is applied to all strings in the list.

.It Cm Selector Pq string
Selector to use when signing messages. Required for signing.

.It Cm SignatureAlgorithm Pq string
Selects the signing algorithm to use when generating signatures.
Use
.Ql openarc \-V
to see the list of supported algorithms.
The default is
.Cm rsa-sha256 .
Other values are not useful if you are intending to interoperate with other
implementers of the ARC protocol.

.It Cm SignHeaders Pq string
Specifies the set of header fields that should be included when generating
signatures.
This is expected to be a comma-separated list of header field names, and
matching is case-insensitive.
If the list omits any header field that is mandated by the ARC specification,
those fields are implicitly added.
By default, those fields listed in the DKIM specification as
"SHOULD" be signed (RFC6376, Section 5.4) will be signed by the filter.

.It Cm Socket Pq string
Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
connections from the MTA.
.Ar socketspec
is in one of two forms:
.Cm local:path,
which creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified
.Ar path ,
or
.Ar inet:port[@host]
or
.Ar inet6:port[@host]
which creates a TCP socket on the specified
.Ar port
and in the specified protocol family.  If the
.Ar host
is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be
listening on all interfaces.  A literal IP address must be enclosed in
square brackets.  This option is mandatory either in the configuration file or
on the command line.

.It Cm SoftwareHeader Pq boolean
Add an ARC-Filter header advertising the filter name and version.

.It Cm Syslog Pq boolean
Log interesting activity to
.Xr syslog 3 .

.It Cm SyslogFacility Pq string
Use the named facility when logging via
.Xr syslog 3 .
The default is
.Cm mail .

.It Cm TemporaryDirectory Pq string
Directory to use when creating temporary files.
The default is
.Pa /tmp

.It Cm TestKeys Pq string
Used for testing.
Name of a file containing static DKIM records that will be used
for validation instead of live DNS lookups, one per line.
This is not useful in a production environment.

.It Cm UMask Pq integer
Requests a specific permissions mask to be used for file creation.
This only applies to creation of the socket when
.Cm Socket
specifies a UNIX domain socket, and to the
.Cm PidFile
(if any).  See
.Xr umask 2
for more information.

.It Cm UserID Pq string
Attempts to become the specified userid before starting operations.
The value is of the form
.Ar userid[:group].
The process will be assigned all of the groups and primary group ID of
the named
.Ar userid
unless an alternate
.Ar group
is specified.
