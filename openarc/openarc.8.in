.Sh NAME
.Nm openarc
.Nd ARC signing and verifying filter for MTAs

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm openarc
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl p Ar socketspec
.Op Fl P Ar pidfile
.Op Fl u Ar userid Op : Ar group
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl V

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
implements the proposed ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) standard
for confirming handling and authentication of a message as it is
handled for delivery.

.Nm
uses the
.Em milter
interface, originally distributed as part of version 8.11 of
.Xr sendmail 8 ,
to provide ARC signing and/or verifying service for mail transiting
a milter-aware MTA.

.Sh OPTIONS

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar configfile
Read the named configuration file.  See the
.Xr openarc.conf 5
man page for details.
Values in the configuration file are overridden when their equivalents
are provided on the command line (but only until a configuration reload
occurs.)
The default is to read a configuration file from
.Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/openarc.conf
if one exists.
If no configuration file is found, default values are used.

.It Fl f
Normally
.Nm
forks and exits immediately, leaving the service running in the background.
This flag suppresses that behaviour so that it runs in the foreground.

.It Fl n
Parse the configuration file and command line arguments, reporting any
errors found, and then exit.
The exit value will be 0 if the filter would start up without complaint,
and non-zero otherwise.

.It Fl p Ar socketspec
Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
connections from
.Xr sendmail 8
in order to provide service.
.Ar socketspec
is in one of two forms:
.Ar local:path
which creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified
.Ar path,
or
.Ar inet:port Op @host
or
.Ar inet6:port Op @host
which creates a TCP socket on the specified
.Ar port
using the requested protocol family.  If the
.Ar host
is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be
listening on all interfaces.
A literal IP address must be enclosed in square brackets.
If neither socket type is specified,
.Cm local
is assumed, meaning the parameter is interpreted as a path at which
the socket should be created.
This parameter is mandatory either here or in the configuration file.

.It Fl P Ar pidfile
Specifies a file into which the filter should write its process ID at startup.

.It Fl u Ar userid Op Ar :group
Attempts to become the specified
.Ar userid
before starting operations.  The process will be assigned all of the groups
and primary group ID of the named
.Ar userid
unless an alternate
.Ar group
is specified.

.It Fl V
Print the version number and build-time options, then exit.

.Sh EXIT STATUS
Filter exit status codes are selected according to
.Xr sysexits 3 .
